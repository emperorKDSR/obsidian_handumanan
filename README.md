# Handumanan — Personal OS for Obsidian

**Handumanan** (forked from [obsidian_diwa](https://github.com/emperorKDSR/obsidian_diwa)) is an Obsidian plugin for capturing thoughts, managing gawa and Bulsa, reviewing your week, and keeping a journal from one connected workspace across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Release: **v1.0.0** · See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for release history.

---

## Current module set

Handumanan’s primary workspace navigation is:

1. **Workspace**
2. **Gawa**
3. **Bulsa**
4. **Review**
5. **Journal**

Supporting tabs and tools still in the plugin:
- **Settings**
- **Bulsa Insights**
- **Monthly Review**
- **Export & Backup**

The current 11.1.0 line no longer includes the removed Search, AI, Voice, Timeline, Synthesis, or Calendar modules.

## Feature overview

### Workspace
- `Open Workspace` routes to the right shell for your platform.
- **Desktop:** dedicated workspace window with sidebar navigation, capture/feed center column, and right task pane.
- **Tablet:** dense touch layout with top tabs and quick actions.
- **Mobile:** bottom-nav shell for Workspace, Review, Bulsa, Gawa, and thoughts.
- **Focus Mode** collapses desktop chrome so the center workspace can expand.

### Quick capture
- Capture **thoughts** and **gawa** from the same flow.
- Supports `#` contexts, `/` people insertion, `[[` note links, and `@date` triggers.
- Handles pasted or dropped files/images in supported editors.
- Keyboard shortcuts: `⌘K / Ctrl+K` to open capture, `⌘↵ / Ctrl+↵` to save.

### Gawa
- Task workspace with Open / Done / Waiting / Someday organization.
- Supports due dates, priority, energy, recurrence, and comments.
- Available from nav or the `Open Gawa` command.

### Bulsa
- Recurring dues ledger backed by notes in the configured Bulsa folder.
- Current ledger toggles between **Active** dues and **All History**.
- Payment logging updates fields such as `last_payment_date` and `next_duedate`.
- `Bulsa Insights` adds income, cashflow, and category breakdown views.

### Review
- **Weekly Review** summarizes work, Bulsa activity, and planning for the next week.
- Week plans support day-by-day intention setting and task assignment.
- Review notes are stored under `Reviews/Weekly/`.
- **Monthly Review** still exists as a supporting DIWA tab, but it is not pinned in the main workspace nav.

### Journal
- `Open Journal` jumps directly into the journal surface.
- Desktop uses a split archive/composer layout.
- Mobile opens directly into the composer.
- Entries support titles, journal types, and inline attachments.

### Export & backup
- `Export & Backup` remains a supporting DIWA tab rather than a main-nav module.
- Thoughts CSV is written to the thoughts folder.
- Gawa CSV is written to the gawa folder.
- Full JSON backups are written to the thoughts folder.

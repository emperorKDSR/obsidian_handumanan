/**
 * Generates a concise, human-readable prompt that guides the user's reflection

 * actual metadata — it is never generic filler.
 *
 * Priority of prompt selection (first match wins):
 *   1. Task was completed after its due date    → ask about the delay
 *   2. Task was resolved in under half a day    → ask what made it easy
 *   3. Task took over a week                    → ask about lessons
 *   4. Task was rescheduled multiple times      → ask about avoidance
 *   5. Task originates from a thought           → ask about expectations
 *   6. Default: open-ended outcome question
 *
 * Never throws; always returns a non-empty string.

/**
 * Produces a short, factual insight about how a completed task was handled.

 *   3. Multiple thought connections
 *   4. Rescheduling pressure

 *
 * Returns a suggestion-only string; the caller decides whether to persist it.
